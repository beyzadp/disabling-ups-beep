# disabling-ups-beep
This repository claims to disable the UPS beep sound which is reportedly not able to be disable on Linux.

If you own a UPS device that doesn't have an easy way to disable the annoying beep sounds when the main power goes out, you can typically turn off the beeping behavior, even if the seller says "there is no way to stop the beep."

To run script on the terminal:

```
sudo chmod +x disabling-ups-beep.sh
./disabling-ups-beep.sh
```
